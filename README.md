# Yarrowia_lipolytica_W29-GEM

- Brief Model Description

This repository contains the current genome-scale metabolic model of _Yarrowia lipolytica_ W29, named **iYali4**. Various different updated versions can be downloaded as [releases](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Yarrowia_lipolytica_W29-GEM/releases).

- Abstract

_Yarrowia lipolytica_ is a promising microbial cell factory for the production of lipids to be used as fuels and chemicals, but there are few studies on regulation of its metabolism. Here we performed the first integrated data analysis of _Y. lipolytica_ grown in carbon and nitrogen limited chemostat cultures. We first reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model and used this for integrative analysis of multilevel omics data. Metabolite profiling and lipidomics was used to quantify the cellular physiology, while regulatory changes were measured using RNAseq. Analysis of the data showed that lipid accumulation in _Y. lipolytica_ does not involve transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism but is associated with regulation of amino-acid biosynthesis, resulting in redirection of carbon flux during nitrogen limitation from amino acids to lipids. Lipid accumulation in _Y. lipolytica_ at nitrogen limitation is similar to the overflow metabolism observed in many other microorganisms, e.g. ethanol production by Sacchromyces cerevisiae at nitrogen limitation.
