# hanpo-GEM: The genome-scale metabolic model of _Hansenula polymorpha_

# Abstract

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a useful framework for modeling the metabolism of microorganisms. While the applications of GEMs are wide and far reaching, the reconstruction and continuous curation of such models can be perceived as a tedious and time-consuming task. Using RAVEN, a MATLAB-based toolbox designed to facilitate the reconstruction analysis of metabolic networks, this protocol practically demonstrates how researchers can create their own GEMs using a homology-based approach. To provide a complete example, a draft GEM for the industrially relevant yeast _Hansenula polymorpha_ is reconstructed.

# Description

This repository contains the current genome-scale metabolic model of _Hansenula polymorpha_, synonymously known as _Ogataea polymorpha_. _Hansenula/Ogataea polymorpha_ is a filamentous yeast from the family _Saccharomycetaceae_, and is an industrially relevant methylotrophic species.
