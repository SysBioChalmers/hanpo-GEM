abstract="Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a useful framework for modeling the metabolism of microorganisms. While the applications of GEMs are wide and far reaching, the reconstruction and continuous curation of such models can be perceived as a tedious and time-consuming task. Using RAVEN, a MATLAB-based toolbox designed to facilitate the reconstruction analysis of metabolic networks, this protocol practically demonstrates how researchers can create their own GEMs using a homology-based approach. To provide a complete example, a draft GEM for the industrially relevant yeast Hansenula polymorpha is reconstructed.",
